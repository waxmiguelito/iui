# Introduction #

See [iUI Web Framework website](http://www.iui-js.org).  The site is still relatively new.  [Feedback welcome.](http://groups.google.com/group/iphonewebdev)

For historical background, you may want to read [Joe Hewitt](http://www.joehewitt.com/)'s [Introductory Blog Post](http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/introducing_iui.php).

You may also want to look at the [Roadmap](Roadmap.md).

# Getting Started #

See [Getting Started](http://www.iui-js.org/documentation/latest/getting-started.html) on the iUI website.

# Examples #

## Current version on Google AppEngine ##
Note: this version roughly corresponds to the iui-0.40-dev2 release.  We are in the process of developing a system so that the examples from the current release (and likely one or more previous releases) will be on-line in the exact same form as they are in the download.
