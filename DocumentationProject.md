# Introduction #

This wiki page will be used for an ever-expanding "table of contents" of the iUI documentation project. The documentation project is in the planning stage and any information on its current progress will be posted here. Suggestions and contributions would be greatly appreciated! You can forward suggestions directly to Stanislav.Bogdanov@gmail.com or post them in the iUI-developers group thread.
