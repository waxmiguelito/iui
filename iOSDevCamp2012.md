# Introduction #

Rather than make yet another iUI-based demo app, this year we (that's Sean with some prodding from Remi) decided to focus on fixing the last major bug before the final release of iUI 0.4 --  [Issue #346](https://code.google.com/p/iui/issues/detail?id=#346) "back-links broken".  Line-count in iui.js down from 1066 down to 1035 well-commented lines.
