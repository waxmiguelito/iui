### Getting Started ###

See [Getting Started with iUI](http://www.iui-js.org/documentation/latest/getting-started.html) on the new iUI website.

### GitHub Source Repository ###

The master source code repository for iUI is the [iUI GitHub repository](https://github.com/iui/iUI)  We're taking [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) over there.  We'll still take them from Google Code's Git Clones (if you ask on the 'iui-developers' group), but frankly, GitHub is so much [nicer](https://github.com/iui/iUI/network).
