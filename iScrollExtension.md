# Introduction #

There is an extension for Matteo Spinelli's (cubiq.org) iScroll under development.   This work is also the basis for the [iPad support](iuiPad.md) as well.

This  work is still pre-alpha, but if you are interested please join us on the iui-developers list.

The code is in the msgilligan-iuiscroll clone of the main iUI source repository.  The tag [CHECKPOINT-before-ipaddevcamp](http://code.google.com/r/msgilligan-iuiscroll/source/list?r=CHECKPOINT-before-ipaddevcamp) marks the best version of iScroll integration BEFORE we began modifications for the iPad.

This  should all be cleaned up and re-integrated shortly.

# Demos #

There are some in-progress demos here:
  * [Music Sample w/iScroll and fixed tab bar](http://msgilligan.appspot.com/samples/music-tabs/music-artists.html)
    * Note:  that the current tab bar is only a 'toggle' between 2 pages not 5 pages as the graphics indicate.
  * [iScroll Demo](http://msgilligan.appspot.com/samples/iscroll-demo/index.html) A copy of the demo from cubiq.org
  * [iScroll Demo - shorter](http://msgilligan.appspot.com/samples/iscroll-demo/index-shorter.html) same as above but with different div size.

Note: These demos are on a temporary GAE instance, because demo.iui-js.org has (more-or-less) the current 'tip' of the main repository and stage.iui-js.org has (more-or-less) the current tip of the msgilligan-iuiscroll clone repository.
