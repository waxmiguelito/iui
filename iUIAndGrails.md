# Introduction #

[Grails](http://grails.org) is a platform for rapid WebApp development using the [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) language.  Groovy is a dynamic language that runs on the Java VM.  It is conceptually similar to Ruby, but with a syntax and class library that is more friendly to Java programmers.  Grails is similar to Ruby on Rails, but is not a simple Rails clone.  It is designed to integrate best-of-breed Open Source Java technologies like Spring and Hibernate.  It is well-suited for Ajax applications like iUI.

# iUI Plugin #

There is a Grails plug-in called, unsurprisingly,  the [Grails iUI Plugin](http://www.grails.org/iUI+Plugin) that is installed into your Grails project with a single command:

```
 grails install-plugin iui
```

For details see the [Grails iUI Plugin](http://www.grails.org/iUI+Plugin) homepage.
